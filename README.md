# NoSQL-Challenge
I feel like I checked last week for a homework and didn't see anything for today. Oh boy do we got some grinding to do, even better with end of the month for work making me do extra time. Thank you chapgpt for your aid and those that have walked a similar path before.

Thank you Kelsey for sending me you whole code when I asked to get help with importing the JSON. It was a great help both to complete the assignment as well as comprehend why the functions worked as intented.

Thank you Liang Iyam for your help from ASKbcs. You pointed out 2 key errors and helped me see the final issue on my own. Still got a fair amount to do but we are almost done.

I think I finished and it all runs without any visible error. Thank you all for your help and lezgiterdun
